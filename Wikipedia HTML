    <div class="History">
        <p>
            In 1230, when for a time the doctors of the University of Paris were scattered, a number of the teachers and
            disciples took refuge in Orléans; when pope Boniface VIII, in 1298, promulgated the sixth book of the
            Decretals, he appointed the doctors of Bologna and the doctors of Orléans to comment upon it.

            St. Yves (1253–1303) studied civil law at Orléans, and Pope Clement V also studied there law and letters; by
            a papal bull published at Lyon, 27 January 1306, he endowed the Orléans institutes with the title and
            privileges of a university.

            Twelve later popes granted the new university many privileges. In the 14th century it had as many as five
            thousand students from France, Germany, Lorraine, Burgundy, Champagne, Picardy, Normandy, Touraine, Guyenne
            and Scotland.

            The current university was founded in 1960, after its medieval predecessor was closed down in 1793 and
            merged into the University of France in 1808
